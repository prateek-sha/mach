Hyundai Creta, a popular name in the SUV segment is known for its distinctive styling highlights and loads of features. The Creta SUV is available in six variants - E, E+, S, SX, SX(O) and SX(O) Executive. The vehicle is a popular choice as a family car as it offers a relaxing drive, courtesy good visibility, planted straight-line stability, and powerful and feedback-rich brakes.

Exterior

The Creta stands out from the crowd with a bigger and shinier grille upfront. The headlamp with DRL signature and all blacked-out internals give it a sporty appeal. The bumper gets a more prominent bash-plate with a redesign for the fog-lamps as well. While the profile is the same, the new design of the alloys adds a bit of sportiness. The tail lamps also get new internals along with subtle design tweaks to the rear bumper.

Interior

The already plush cabin of the Creta has received minor tweaks like the contrasting metallic finish on the air-con vents. The company has added a new top spec version, the SX(O) Executive variant which offers ventilated seats for the front row seats in addition to features like an electric sunroof, lane change indicator flash adjustment, 17-inch diamond cut alloy and more. In terms of safety, the six-airbag package with rear-camera for parking has also been continued.

The 1.4-litre diesel engine generates 89bhp of power at 4000rpm and 220Nm of torque at 1500rpm. The 1.6-litre diesel, on the other hand, generates 126bhp of power at 4,000rpm and 260Nm of torque at 1,500rpm.
